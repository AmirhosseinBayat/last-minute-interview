# Design Patterns
 - *Definition:* A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

## Examples ([link](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans))
 - Creational design patterns
   - Factory (Creates an instance of several derived classes)
   - Singleton (A class of which only a single instance can exist)
   - Prototype (A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned)
   - Abstract Factory (Creates an instance of several families of classes)
 - Structural design patterns
   - Adapter (Match interfaces of different classes)
   - Decorator (Add responsibilities to objects dynamically)
   - Facade (A single class that represents an entire subsystem)
   - Proxy (An object representing another object)
 - Behavioral design patterns
   - Chain of responsibility (A way of passing a request between a chain of objects)
   - Iterator (Sequentially access the elements of a collection)
   - Mediator (Defines simplified communication between classes)
   - Null Object (Designed to act as a default value of an object)
   - Observer (A way of notifying change to a number of classes)
   - Template method (Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass)
 - Other
   - MVC

   + Chains:
```
                FORWARD, POSTROUTING
               /
     PREROUTING
               \
                INPUT, OUTPUT
```
   + Tables: `Nat`, `Filter`, `Mangle`
   + Policies:
     * `ACCEPT`: allow through
     * `DROP`: block, no reply
   + extended polices
     * `REJECT`: block, with reply
     * `LOG`: allow, log
     * `MASQUERADE`: change the packet
