# Design Patterns
 - *Definition:* A general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

## Examples
 - Creational design patterns
  - Factory (Creates an instance of several derived classes)
  - Singleton (A class of which only a single instance can exist)
  - Prototype (A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned)
  - Abstract Factory (Creates an instance of several families of classes)
 - Structural design patterns
  - Adapter (Match interfaces of different classes)
  - Decorator (Add responsibilities to objects dynamically)
  - Facade (A single class that represents an entire subsystem)
  - Proxy (An object representing another object)
 - Behavioral design patterns
  - Chain of responsibility (A way of passing a request between a chain of objects)
  - Iterator (Sequentially access the elements of a collection)
  - Mediator (Defines simplified communication between classes)
  - Null Object (Designed to act as a default value of an object)
  - Observer (A way of notifying change to a number of classes)
  - Template method (Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass)
 - Other
  - MVC
